### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ğŸ˜€

<!--
**Abe-Borg/Abe-Borg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning the basics of software development and the fundamental tools we need to succeed, like learning how to use GitHub and all its tools for example. I worked hard during my bachelor's of computer science degree program at CSU Monterey Bay. I feel like I have a solid foundation of knowledge, but there is still so much to learn.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basic tools like Git and GitHub. I'm also practicing Python and Julia because I like to work on data analysis and also some basic machine learning. My capstone project was about machine learning, you can see it at my other repo, https://github.com/abecsumb/CST499-40_FA22-Capstone-BradleyChess
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis and machine learning projects. In particular, I want to learn more about reinforced learning. The dream is to one day get a PhD and do research in the machine learning field.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with developing ChatGPT plugins and also basic web app development.
